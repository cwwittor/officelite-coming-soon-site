## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to use Javascript components to make a real time countdown timer.

I also had reinforced some thoughts on how max-width should work at desktop size

### Continued development

After this project had been going on for a while I felt a little rushed to deliver an output so it led me to get a little lazy with variables and css, in the future I want this to look better but I am currently content with how it looks.

Absolute background values are still a problem for me, especially svgs.
